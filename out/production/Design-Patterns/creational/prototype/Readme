Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

** Problem

Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it?
First, you have to create a new object of the same class. Then you have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.
Nice! But there’s a catch.
Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object itself.

There’s one more problem with the direct approach. Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate, your code becomes dependent on that class.
If the extra dependency doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch.
Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but not its concrete class, when, for example, a parameter in a method accepts any objects that follow some interface.

** Solution

The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned.
The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning.
This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object.
Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.

The implementation of the clone method is very similar in all classes.
The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field values of the old object into the new one.
You can even copy private fields because most programming languages let objects access private fields of other objects that belong to the same class.

An object that supports cloning is called a prototype.
When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.

** Applicability

1) Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldn’t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
This happens a lot when your code works with objects passed to you from 3rd-party code via some interface.
The concrete classes of these objects are unknown, and you couldn’t depend on them even if you wanted to.

2) Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.

 Suppose you have a complex class that requires a laborious configuration before it can be used.
 There are several common ways to configure this class, and this code is scattered through your app.
 To reduce the duplication, you create several subclasses and put every common configuration code into their constructors.
 You solved the duplication problem, but now you have lots of dummy subclasses.

 The Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects configured in various ways as prototypes.
 Instead of instantiating a subclass that matches some configuration, the client can simply look for an appropriate prototype and clone it.

** How to implement

1) Create the prototype interface and declare the clone method in it.
   Or just add the method to all classes of an existing class hierarchy, if you have one.

2) A prototype class must define the alternative constructor that accepts an object of that class as an argument.
   The constructor must copy the values of all fields defined in the class from the passed object into the newly created instance.
   If you’re changing a subclass, you must call the parent constructor to let the superclass handle the cloning of its private fields.

3) The cloning method usually consists of just one line: running a new operator with the prototypical version of the constructor.
   Note, that every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own class name along with the new operator.
   Otherwise, the cloning method may produce an object of a parent class.

4) Optionally, create a centralized prototype registry to store a catalog of frequently used prototypes.
   You can implement the registry as a new factory class or put it in the base prototype class with a static method for fetching the prototype.
   This method should search for a prototype based on search criteria that the client code passes to the method.
   The criteria might either be a simple string tag or a complex set of search parameters.
   After the appropriate prototype is found, the registry should clone it and return the copy to the client.

** Pros
1) You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.
2) You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.
3) You can produce complex objects more conveniently.
4) You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.

** Cons
1)  Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.
